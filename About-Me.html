    </Section><h3>Biography</h3>
    <p> I'm chisom, a curious and ambitious individual with a passion for technology and innovation. 
        Growing up, l've always been fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers. 
        Inspired by industry leaders and innovators, I began my journey in tech, 
        starting with the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I delved deeper, 
        I discovered my true calling: cloud engineering. I'm now dedicated to expanding my skill set and 
        knowledge in this field, driven by the desire to design, build, and innovate cloud-based solutions. 
        When I'm not immersed in code or studying, you can find me learning French, honing my language skills,
         or working as a customer relation manager. I'm also an avid reader, always looking to expand my 
         knowledge and broaden my perspectives. As I continue on this journey, I'm excited to share my 
         experiences, insights, and knowledge with others. My goal is to inspire and mentor those entering 
         the tech field, paying it forward and contributing to a community that has given me so much.</p>

    <h3>Why i joined the Altschool Program</h3>
    <p>I'll never forget my classmate from cloud computing school. She was a rockstar - detailed, knowledgeable, and grounded in the basics. I, on the other hand, felt lost in the complexity. I knew I needed a program that would give me the same solid foundation she had. That's why I joined AltSchool. I needed a program that would take the time to teach me the skills I wanted to learn, without overwhelming me. Their 12-month program, with its supportive community, scholarship opportunities, and hands-on learning approach, felt like the perfect fit. As I embark on this journey with AltSchool, I'm filled with excitement and anticipation. I'm looking forward to gaining the expertise and confidence to tackle complex cloud computing projects. I envision myself designing and deploying scalable, secure, and efficient cloud solutions that make a real impact. With AltSchool's guidance and support, I'm ready to unlock my full potential and become a proficient cloud developer, capable of achieving my dreams and making a difference in the tech world.</p>
